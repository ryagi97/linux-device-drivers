# linux-device-drivers

Repo to hold code and docs as I follow along the 
**Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition**, by *Jonathan Corbet, 
Alessandro Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman*.

Code is modified in places to help me understand better, and is supplemented 
by my own comments for clearer explenations.
